            Apex Legends

              </li>
              <li>
                Apex is a free to play game which is one of the reasons<br />
                why it is so succesful Apex is also off the Titanfall franchise<br />
                being in the same universe which is another reason the game is so popular.

                The game is ok I mostly play the zombies mode for the camos and <br />
                so I can have fun with my friends and dad. Cold War improved zo,bies a little bit <br />
                they gave the zombies a health bar above there heads and gave gun different rarities <br />
                so that way you try to use a gun and level it up to go higher rounds than before they <br />
                also added a little mission to each zombies map and atleast 2-3 easter eggs in each map.

            Fallout 4

                Fallout 4 is one of the best fallout games it has 4 different endings <br />
                and introduces mod support to console and better mod support for PC <br />
                allowing some of us Pc users to play fallout 4 online with some of the mods<br />
                the game also improves the power armor in a way not needing training to use it <br />
                but allowing the armor to be on a frame so you can change all the pieces to what you like.
